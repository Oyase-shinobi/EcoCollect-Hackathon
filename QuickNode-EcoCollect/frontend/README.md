# EcoCollect Frontend

## Project Description
The frontend of **EcoCollect** provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the EcoCollect platform. It enables plastic waste pickers and recycling companies to seamlessly engage in the collection and payment process. The interface is designed to offer a smooth and intuitive experience for registering pickers, registering companies, depositing plastic waste, paying pickers, and viewing transaction histories. 

## Importance in Our Current Society
The EcoCollect frontend simplifies the interaction between users and the blockchain-based system, making it accessible for everyday users. It plays a vital role in ensuring transparency in transactions, encouraging more people to actively participate in plastic waste recycling efforts. With an engaging and interactive design, it promotes environmental sustainability through a decentralized, community-driven approach.
